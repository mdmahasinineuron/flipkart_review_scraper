Athul Shabu, 5, Top class performance  and battery backup too. Charges quickly if u are using a 20w charger. Night mode is good   HDR mode works flawlessly. VFM phone.,
Ayaz Ahmad, 5, Almost 1month of purshase and i am loving it . Great for photography and videography and trust me the stability of video is awesome . High end performence in Gaming   the only problem is that it heats up a little while playing Bgmi but if u play in a AC room then there's no issue .The boxy look of iphone 12 is very good and it gives a premium feel while holding . worth buying . also if you are confused between iph 11 or iph12 then close your eyes and go for iphone 12 .,
