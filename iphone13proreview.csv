Rukhsar Sheikh, 5, Great phone  mindblowing. Performance wise to hatssoff. Looks are stunning  camera awesome.Sierra blue is very light shade.  Silver and this not much difference.I got it on 25th sept Very fast delivery!! Battery is quite good stays one full day with moderate use.,
Akash Karmakar, 5, Finally the best purchase of this season. Awesome colour  great performance and stunning looks. Camera module is massive and performance as well.,
Krishna Ashok, 5, Performance is nowhere comparable.Camera quality can be debatable you have other choices with much lesser cost.Video quality is undeniably the best   none can surpass the standards.Battery performance is something which they have definitely worked on and it’s awesome . Overall it’s an amazing phone   but is it worth spending a lakh   that is debatable again.,
Neeraj Trikha, 5, I moved to 13 Pro from an 11 Pro and this new phone is amazing. The cameras are better  battery life is much improved and I like this new design.And the 120hz screen  which is way brighter  is a delight to see and scroll through.Flipkart delivered the phone ahead of schedule (as always).,
Amit Tanwar, 5, Superb phone when I opened   build quality is as good as Apple is know .Still heating is observed when I started and connected to WiFi within 5-10 min.Rest camera is superb . Cinematic video is excellent .Touch is so smooth .Good as compare to 12 pro.,
Flipkart Customer, 5, As usual classic Apple  if you are planning to switch from any iphone older than 11 gen then opt for the pro model  pro max would be humongous in size. Camera and display are same but if you have large fingers and need battery to last 2 days with normal use then go for the max model.Opt for 256gb model as the promotion is only available in 4k for 256 and above model  it's available in 1080p for 128gb models.,
Flipkart Customer, 5, Worth upgrading if you are using iphone x or older  like i have used iphone x for 4 years and now upgrading  but won’t recommend to upgrade if already using 11 pro or 12 pro.,
Biswajit  Choudhury, 5, Received the iphone 13 pro 256 gb with in stipulated time frame  thanks to Flipkart  worth every penny  very nice quality iphone I ever used with respect to great battery  camera and 120hz screen...,
